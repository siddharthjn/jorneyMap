              <li><p><b>Workstation Setup/Documentation</b></p><p>Before I joined Panorama, it used to take 1 month for a new developer on the team to setup his workstation. As a team of new graduates in Halifax, we documented every problem,step and solutions with screenshots on the wiki. This drastically reduced time from 1 month to mere 3-4 days to setup the workstation. <br> As a result we were able to cut down the cost by 3 weeks per resource enabling new resources to start delivering after being for 1 week on the account.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Overdelivering for 2.5.7 Beta Release</b></p><p>As a team of early professionals in Halifax, we were faced with a daunting task of delivering critical solutions for the 2.5.7 release. <br>We leveraged the senior resources based in Burnaby and coordinated with our counterparts in India only to find out that we had overdelivered vs the client's expectations. As a team, we recieved special mention from scrum master and clients for this accomplishment.</p></li>

              <h3>Innovation</h3>
              <li><p><b>Overcoming Limitations</b></p><p>One of my achievement in my project was to work on a very non-standard request from PNS to convert hourly employees on open work schedules and making them salaried pay from hourly pay. It was not a recommended best practice as we advised PNS, however, they persisted in requesting this change. This solution was very important for business because they were going to hire/update over 300 Seasonal employees. The complexity of the solution increased because these employees did not have fixed bi-weekly hours. This was a long standing ticket which through my tenacity I was able to close; this was quite imperative for the team and client as well. I did require a lot of direction since it required very advanced and deep expertise, exploring pay period salary proration and factoring. We noted down all the assumptions taken in consideration for the configuration and created documents for business to make them aware of the new solution going to take place. Following the IBM Practice “Put the client first” I took up the challenge, did an enormous amount of testing and outlined for the client what SAP can do and what limitations exist.  </p></li>

Very early on, I was acknowledged by my manager and SAP Lead for taking the initiative to research/look up and participate in formal SAP training relevant for my role.  My leadership then helped them develop a training plan for others. Within a year of experience, I became the Queue Manager for the SAP Time Management team. As per the role, my responsibilities include reviewing, analyzing and providing the first level of problem solving for every ticket received. This role has helped me develop and hone my skills in all areas of SAP Time Management. I put in a consistent effort to ensure all requests are actioned within SLA targets.  My throughput in this area has been called out by the client and my SAP Lead as being substantial.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>SAP Migration</b></p><p>Along with the steady state project, I have participated in SAP Migration, upgradation and Enhancement pack projects. I developed my general HCM business process skill by participating in these additional projects.  During these activities I performed testing as required for all areas. </p></li>
